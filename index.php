<p>We are a group of people connected with a single objective to serve and inspire others to serve for the society.
</p>
<p>
The main objective of silentservice is to inspire and enable more people to perform service towards the society.
</p>
<p>
A service performed by a single individual or a particular organization is limited to the
capacity of that particular individual or organization.
</p>
<p>
A significant impact on the society is possible if each individual in the society owns a social service initiative and inspires others to perform the same.</p>

<p>
<strong>Eventually creating a chain of social service initiatives that will cummulatively have a significant impact on the uplift of the society</strong>
</p>
<p>
Silence in silentservice refers to staying away or calming the thought of "I am doing".Thereby an individual performs service to the society like a servant not accumulating or boosting his/her inner ego.The members of the group will be referred as silentservants.
</p>
<p>
Every service initiative will be owned and lead by one of the silent servant.He/She will publish his/her initiative to serve the society.If any of the silentservants in the group wants to support/participate in the initiative, they will confirm by mentioning " Iam in " else they will remain silent.
</p>
<p>
None of the silentservants that are participating in the initiative are allowed to provide their opinions on any of the social service initiatives.
